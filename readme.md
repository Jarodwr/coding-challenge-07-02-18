## NOTES:
If the page content isn't loading you are likely getting curl errors related to your PHP installation, this is fixable by downloading a new certificate bundle from https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and adding adding the following line to your php.ini: `curl.cainfo = "path_to_cert\cacert.pem"`.
I placed my cacert.pem in `C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.1.9\extras\ssl\cacert.pem` so I added `curl.cainfo = "C:\wamp64\bin\php\php7.1.9\extras\ssl\cacert.pem"` to my php.ini.
